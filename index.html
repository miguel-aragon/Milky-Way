      Below is an interactive map of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Sheet" target="_blank">Local Sheet</a> around the Milky Way and extending up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster" target="_blank">Virgo Cluster</a> of galaxies. You can watch it on VR of you can look around from the point of view of our galaxy. Spheres represent galaxies colored with the density of matter and scaled with their size. The three circles centered on the Milky Way indicate distances of 1,3 and 5 Mpc. The large purple sphere on top represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Void" target="_blank">Local Void</a>. Some well known structures are labeled.
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
      You can enter an "inspector" mode which gives you more control over the 3D scene. In order to have a correct perspective follow these steps: first click on the VR logo at the bottom-right corner of the image. Then press the following key sequence:  &lt;ctrl&gt; + &lt;alt&gt; + i (windows) or &lt;control&gt; +  &lt;option&gt; + i (mac). You can now rotate and zoom-in/out with the mouse and scroll wheel.
